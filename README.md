Overview

This progam was created for a person to be able to enter in a recipe and the ingredients names and the program will change the ingredients to the desired change. 

Bugs Debugged in the Program

To be able to enter in a two worded ingredient and the type of measurments, the program will only allow no spaces. The solution that was found is to enter a word with a dash and then another dash for the measurment. An example is White-Flour_cup. The first two words are of white flour and the last word is seperated to say the measurment was in cups, not another type of measurment. 

Bugs in Hiding

There are some bugs that are not worked out such as, instead of the program asking to enter the number of ingredients again, the program goes straight to asking the ingredient name and amount of ingredients. I am still working on that. 

Finale

The program should work for simple recipes and is relatively easiy. There are different ways to do this kind of program and I chose an easier simpler code. The code is great for modifying recipes and will hopefully be great in the results.
