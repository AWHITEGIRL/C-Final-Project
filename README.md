Overview

This progam was created for a person to be able to enter in a recipe and the ingredients names and the program will change the ingredients to the desired change. 

Bugs Debugged in the Program

To be able to enter in a two worded ingredient and the type of measurments, the program will only allow no spaces. The solution that was found is to enter a word with a dash and then another dash for the measurment. An example is White-Flour_cup. The first two words are of white flour and the last word is seperated to say the measurment was in cups, not another type of measurment.
